Here's a 2-sentence teaser for **The Last Roar**:

**"The world is ending, and the last of its kind stands alone... Will Kael, the battle-scarred T-Rex, be the final echo of a bygone era?"**

Or, alternatively:

**"A deafening roar echoes through the desolate landscape, but it's not just a sound - it's a final farewell to a world that's about to be lost forever..."**
