**The Last Roar**

As the asteroid hurtled towards the Earth, Kael, a battle-scarred Tyrannosaurus Rex, stood atop a hill, its piercing eyes scanning the horizon. The air reeked of ozone and smoke, and the sky that was once blue now hung like a sickly yellow shroud. The ground trembled beneath Kael's feet, and the sound of the asteroid's impact was a deafening roar that shook the earth's foundations.

Kael's instincts screamed at it to flee, but its legs felt rooted to the spot. It let out a mighty roar, a primal challenge to the impending doom. The sound echoed through the desolate landscape, a defiant cry that seemed to shake the very trees themselves. But it was a futile attempt. The asteroid's impact sent shockwaves through the planet, causing earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. The once-green forests were now scorched and blackened, the trees reduced to smoldering stumps. The air was thick with the acrid smell of burning wood and the stench of death.

As the dust settled, Kael stood alone, its eyes fixed on the horizon. The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the distant rumble of thunder and the faint cries of dying creatures. Kael's roar was now a mere whisper, a faint echo of a time long past. It thought of its pack, its family, its home â€“ all lost forever. The T-Rex's eyes seemed to cloud, and for a moment, it felt the weight of its years, the accumulation of scars and wounds, the memories of countless battles fought and won.

And then, in an instant, it was over. The darkness closed in, and Kael's final thought was of the world it had once known, a world that was now lost forever. The last of its kind, the last of a species that had ruled the earth for millions of years, Kael's final roar was a mere whisper, a faint echo that faded into the eternal silence.
